  <h2> Germany </h2>
  <h3> CBYX</h3>
  <p> Germany is one of the <em>closest</em> allies to the United States. In fact, in 1983, <a href="http://culturalvistas.org/programs/abroad/congress-bundestag-youth-exchange-young-professionals/"> Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young Professionals (CBYX)</a> was established. This Program is funded by the United States and the German Bundestag, allowing 75 young Germans and 75 young Americans to participate in the exchange each year. </p>
